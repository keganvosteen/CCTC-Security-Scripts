Linux Commands and Notes:

Cat /etc/sudoers >> must edit with visudo

Sudo-l exploit:

cat /var/log/syslog (permission denied)
sudo cat /var/log/shadow (permission denied)
sudo cat /var/log/syslog /etc/shadow

SUID/GUID


SUID files: find / -type f -perm /4000 -ls 2>/dev/null
GUID files: find / -type f -perm /2000 -ls 2>/dev/null
Both: find / -type f -perm /6000 -ls 2>/dev/null

Be sure to check for a “dot” in the PATH
If there is one can you create your own script (sharing a name of another one) to exploit something?

CRON:

/var/spool/cron/crontabs
/etc/crontab

World Writeables:

Other bit is set to +X, which allows anyone to write to it.

find / -type f -perm /2 -o -type d -perm /2 2>/dev/null
find / -type f -writable -o -type d -writable 2>/dev/null
Best one: find / -type d -perm /2 2>/dev/null

Logs systemd

Look in /var/log:

Logs typically housed in /var/log, some useful logs:

lastlog --- each users successful login time
btmp --- tracks bad login attempts
secure --- Syslog
sulog --- use of su command
utmp --- users currently on (w)
wtmp --- permanent record on user on/off
auth.log/secure --- tracks usage of authorization
