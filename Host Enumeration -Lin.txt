Host Enumeration - Find ports for each host that are online
nmap -sS -Pn 10.50.30.41 -p 135-139,22,80,443,21,8080
	-Pn is required because proxychains does not allow ICMP traffic
	-sS is the default if run as root, if you are not root you need sudo privs to run -sS. It sends SYN but does not respond to SYN/ACK

nmap -sT -Pn 10.100.28.40 -p 135-139,22,80,443,21,8080
